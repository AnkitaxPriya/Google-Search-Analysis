## Purpose 

This repository consists of Google search analysis with Python.

## Motivation behind the project

Everyday billions of users rely on Google to carry out their daily searches. It comes as no surprise that Google is the most visited website. To put a number on it, Google has been visited 62.19 billion times this year (Similarweb, 2019). 

Google processes over 3.5 billion searches per day (Internetlivestats, 2019). 
If you break this statistic down, it means that Google processes over 40,000 search queries every second on average.

For that matter, Google becomes a use case for analyzing data based on search queries. 

## Coding Language, IDE and  Libraries used 
All coding woeks are done in Python 3.9 and the IDE used to create them was using Anaconda's **Jupyter Notebook**, you can download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). 

The following libraries were used:
- Python API called `pytrends`
  - Install it using 
    ```
    !pip install pytrends
    ```
- Matplotlib 
- Pandas
